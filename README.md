# Eyes

Project title: Eye movement project

Project Description: This project demonstrates the use of events in JavaScript. In this case, the
event is any movememnt of the mouse, which causes the eyeballs to move to follow the movement of
the mouse. The eyeballs are a class within an html "div" tag whose position is modified in the
styles.css file whenever the mouse is moved.

How to run: Download index.html, eyes.js, and styles.css to the same folder. Run index.html in web
browswer, either by dragging and dropping the file into the web browser, selecting the web browser
under the "open with" tab, or any other method. The program will then run in your browswer window.

Future improvements: This project can be enhanced in the future by adding more styles to improve the
user interface. Additional features may also be added by allowing the user to select the number and
placement of eyes.
